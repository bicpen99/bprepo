<P>The Company Information System contains information pertaining to Operators, Purchasers, Pluggers,
Soil Farm Contractors, Commercial Pit Owners and Recycler/Reclaiming Plant Owners.  It also contains
detail information regarding One Time Land Applications, Commercial Pits, Recycling/Reclaiming Plants,
and Commercial Disposal Wells.  Depending on the security level of the user, the system allows viewing,
editing, and deleting of company and detail information. Also, depending upon the users security level,
the user can run and print reports and maintain lookup/utility table information.  The Company Information
System allows access, in a central location, to information pertaining to most of the companies regulated
by the Oil & Gas Conservation Division.</P>

<P>To maintain data integrity, the ability to add, edit and delete information is determined by User ID.  This is an ID
assigned by OCC, Data Processing.  Public users have view only rights and will not be allowed to view sensitive information
such as social security numbers.  Most people are classified as public users. This includes all web users and all
in house users that do not work in the specific section.  In the following documentation, help for the public
will be listed first <span style='color:#00716E'>and then more detailed help
for the specific section will follow and be displayed in a contrasting color.</span></P>

<P>All Company Information System forms have some similarities.  This section will explain
each feature.</P>

<P>A few helpful terms are:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;field - An individual screen item such as operator number or company name.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;record - A collection of related items such as an office with address information.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;master record - The parent company record or a main record which is superior to some detail records.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;detail record - The subordinate records related to a master record.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lookup window - A window that opens and contains possible values for a selected field.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;form - A visual interface to the database complete with fields, buttons, rules etc. all related a business entity.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;query mode - When the form is in query mode it is able to accept data which is used to query the database.</P>

<P>The toolbar that is available for use in this application offers many functions.  If you are unsure of what an icon will do,
the mouse cursor can be paused over the buttons and "help text" will appear that will explain what the button does.</P>

<P>When querying a record, the Enter Query <img border=0 width=20 height=20 src="entqry.gif"> and Execute Query
<img border=0 width=20 height=20 src="exeqry.gif"> buttons can be used.  An alternate way to put the form in Enter Query
mode is by using the F7 key and Execute Query by using the F8 key.  After the form is in query mode, enter some bit of
information which can be used to search the database then execute the query.

<P>Buttons used for data entry are the Insert Record Button <img border=0 width=20 height=20 src="insrec.gif">
and the Remove Record Button<img border=0 width=20 height=20 src="delrec.gif">.

<P>Character indicators are located on the labels of some items.  Each indicator has a unique meaning.</P>

<P>   #   The pound sign is an indication that the field is expandable.  When the field is entered, it will expand
so that the entire contents can be viewed.  When the field is exited, it will shrink back down so that all
fields are in view.</P>

<P>   *   The astrict is an indication that the field is required.  To create a new record, this bit of information
must be filled in to proceed.</P>

<P>   !   The exclamation point indicates that when the field is double-clicked, an action will be performed.  This
action could be a lookup window which allows you to make a selection. If security allows, it can change the
value of, or put a default value in, the current field.</P>

<P>   @   The "at" symbol indicates a comment field and if double-clicked it will bring up a text
edit box which may display a small paragraph of text or allow for adding and editing text.

<P>Blue labels indicate the field is not updatable.  This is a quick indication for data entry
personnel to skip those fields. Fields with blue labels are usually updated by a report or
some procedure inside the form.</P>

<P>At the bottom of each form is audit information.  The audit information usually consist
of date_created, date_modified, user_created and user_modified.  If your screen resolution is
set to 800X600, this information is not visible unless the scroll bars are used.  This information is
useful when determining by whom and when the information was created or modified.</P>

<P>When the ! indicator is encountered on items such as the City, there are several ways to do the data entry on this
item.  If the City is simply typed in and the enter key or tab key is used, a lookup window will open and allow the correct
zip code to be selected. If the City or Zip is not currently in the table, then it will need to be added to the Zip Code
Table which is available under the Reports and Utilities tab in the Operator and Plugger forms. To add a City and Zip Code
simply choose the Insert Record button(+) at the top of the form and type in the State, City, Zip.</P>

<P><!-----------------OPERATORS AND PURCHASERS PAGE-------------------------------------PAGE 5--></P>

<a name=Operators><b><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>Operators and Purchasers</a> </span></b></a>

<P>Information contained in this section is specific to the Operator form.  For more general
information please read the <a href="#Introduction"><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Introduction</span></a>.</p>

<P>The Operator form is for viewing, maintaining or adding Oil & Gas Operator and Purchaser information.
Companies that are not Operators or Purchasers may be viewed from the Operator form but cannot be modified.
The default for the Operator form is to bring up all types of Companies.  To narrow your search,
in the Operator form, to pull Companies of a specific type, simply remove the check marks from the
types that are not desired. <img border=0 width=250 height=25 src="TYPES.JPG"> Although, unchecking a company
type that is not desired could produce undesired effects. For example, unchecking the reclaimer checkbox
could cause you to inadvertantly eliminate an operator if that operator was also a commercial pit owner.</P>

<P>The Operator screen has a Browse and a Detail tab page in the upper section of the form
and multiple tab pages in the lower section of the form.  The Browse tab allows the viewing of more than one
master record. Stay on the Browse tab to query a record and then go to the Detail tab after you have made your
selection.  The Detail tab shows more detailed information for the record selected in the browse tab.
The Browse tab allows you to scroll or arrow up and down and select the desired company record but the
Detail tab locks you onto the selected record to prevent accidentally changing companies.</P>

<P>The tab pages at the lower half of the screen contain detail information related to the master or
company record selected in the upper portion of the screen.  There are three sub tabs and each sub tab
contains four sub-sub tabs. The best way to aquaint yourself with the information provided is to navigate
through the tabs and examine them.</P>

<P>The percent character can be used to query companies in cases where the exact full company name may not be known.
Example:  Well% This query will return all Companies that begin with "Well". The query could return Well Services, Well Company,
ect. After the desired record is found, highlight the record and then choose the detail tab to see further information.
The lower set of tabs will bring up more detailed information related to the company you have selected. Some of the
information may not be visible to the public, so that the privacy of the company and officers of the company can be maintained.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><img border=0 width=576 height=432 src=G97OPER1.JPG></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><span style='color:#00716E'>The Insert Record Button button will be used to add a new master or company record.
The detail information will be added by clicking into an empty record or using the down arrow to navigate to a new or
empty record unless you are adding a new record to the Zip Code Table in which case you would use the insert button.  </P>

<P><span style='color:#00716E'>To delete detail records just click in any item or field of the record and choose the
Remove Record <img border=0 width=20 height=20 src="delrec.gif"> Button.  The Company Master Record cannot be deleted if
any detail information exist and then can only be deleted with Surety Manager Rights.</span></P></P>

<P><span style='color:#00716E'>When records are being entered, the record can be saved at any time during data entry by
choosing Action, Save on the toolbar or clicking on the Save Icon.  Each form will automatically save information anytime
the tab pages are changed.  If you do not want to save changes, exit the form and elect not to save.</P>

<P>To insert a new Operator or Purchaser choose the Insert Record button and then begin entering
data.  The Operator Number will be assigned automatically.  The Company Name must be entered before you can
navigate to any other fields.  When the Offices records are ready to be added, the form automatically gets the first office
name from the main or master record.</P>

<P>When adding detail records such as offices or officers, as many records as needed can be added.
The Offices will be listed in sub number order. The sub numbers which correspond to the operator suffix will be added
automatically but can be edited if that is your wish. When the sub number reaches 9, it will repeat; nevertheless, more offices
still can be entered.</P>

<P>After all the Name and Address information has been added, navigate to the Surety and Related Information tab and
a new set of sub tabs will appear that will allow the entry of Surety and Surety Related information.</P>

<P>Under the Surety tab, the Bank Name is a look-up field.  Type in all or part of the Bank Name
and double-click in the field to initiate the look-up window, then scroll through the choices until the desired Bank Name
is displayed. If the Bank is not in the look-up window, then enter the Bank information, saved it and it will appear
on the next lookup.</P>

<P>There are many date fields in the forms with the ! indicator. When the field is double-clicked, it will put in today's
date.  Highlight and change whatever portion of the date that is not correct if today's date is not the date you desire.</P>

<P>Under the Reject Surety and 1006B tabs, just double click in the rejection reason
field to list the default rejection reasons.  When the default rejection reasons lookup window appears,
select a reason by double-clicking the reason or highlighting the reason and clicking 'OK'.  The reason
will appear in the corresponding Surety or 1006B rejection reasons for this operator and ultimately on a
rejection letter for the rejected operator.</P>

<P>The rejection reasons are not limited to the default reasons.  Rejection reasons can
be typed into the field as needed.  To add, edit or delete from the default rejection reasons, select the
Reports and Utilities tab and then the corresponding subtab and enter or edit the reason you wish to change.
Rejection reasons are the only items in the Operator form which can take lower case letters. This is done
to allow lower case rejection reasons on the rejection letters if that is your wish.</span></P>

<P>The Reports tab which is under the Reports and Utilities tab is used to run reports that are generated for the system.
Information under this tab cannot be updated except by running a report.  The report information gives you the ability
to see if and when the report is due.  This is determined by the last Run Date and how often the report is due to run.
The Run Date is used to help you determine when the report was last run.  The From Date is the Beginning Date for the
Report and the To Date is the Ending Date of the report.  The Run By shows who last ran the report.
The Information field gives a brief description of how often the report should be run and what records
it will retrieve.</span></P>

<a name="FACILITIES"><B><span style='font-size:18.0pt'>Recycler/Reclaimers, Comm Pits and Comm Disposal Wells</span></B></A></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>This form provides information on Recycler/Reclaimers, Commercial Pits, Commercial Disposal Wells
and companies that operate these types of facilities. Information contained in this section is specific
to the Facilities form. For more general information please read the <a href="#Introduction"><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Introduction</span></a>.</p>

<P>A first inspection of this form reveals three tabs located at the top left corner of the screen.
First is the Location tab, then Location Detail and third is Company Detail.  Under the Location tab
you will see three palettes. The palettes can be minimized or restored by clicking the upper right
hand corner of the palette. The first palette is the Reports Palette and it is minimized when the
form is initially opened because it doesn't get the constant use like the second and third palettes.
The Reports Palette will run four separate reports. One for each of the facility types and one report
which is a listing of the records on display in the Location browse screen.</P>

<P>The second palette is the Query Palette.  Information at the facility level can be viewed by
selecting the appropriate query button from the Query Pallette. The first column of buttons labeled 'All'
will select and display all facilities for a type depending upon the row of the button. The second row
of buttons displays a facility type for a selected county. The third row of buttons displays a facility
type for a selected company and the companies are selected from a lookup of companies ordered by company
name. Finally, the fourth row of buttons displays a facility type for a selected company and the
companies are selected from a lookup of companies ordered by company number. The fourth row of buttons
allows the user to change the sort order. The sort order can be determined before or after the query.
The Location sort button sorts by Township, Range and Section or you can sort by county, company name
or company number.</P>

<P>The third palette is the Function Palette.  The Function Palette buttons may become active or inactive
depending on your level of security and the type of facility you have selected.  The first two functions,
'Add Facility' and 'Change Ownership' are used only for data entry. The Show/Edit 1014A will display volumes
in barrels for each year that a 1014A has been received and entered into the system. The 1014A is the
Commercial Mud Disposal Annual Report required by Recycler/Reclaimers and Commercial Pits. If the
facility is a Commercial Disposal Well, the Show 1012A and Show MIT buttons will activate.The 1012A
is the volume report for Disposal Wells and the MIT is a Mechanical Integrity Test performed on Disposal
and Injection Wells. </P>

<P>Section, Township and Range fields can be used as delimiters by double-clicking on them. This is done
to allow the user to further limit their selection. Double-click on the Township and all facilities not in
that Township are removed. Double-click on the Range and all facilities not in that Township and Range
are removed and so on with the Section.</P>

<P></P>

<P><img border=0 width=576 height=432 src="G97FACL1.JPG"></P>

<P></P>
<P>Depending on the Facility type selected, some items may or may not appear on the screen.
Order Number and API Number will appear in the upper right hand corner when a commercial well is selected.
Order Number and Public/Private appear when a Commercial Pit is selected and nothing appears in the upper
right hand corner if the facility is a recycler/reclaimer. </P>

<P>The second tab is the Location Detail tab. More detailed information can be viewed for the selected
facility by selecting the Location Detail Tab.  Information displayed on the Location Detail Tab is
specific to the facility type.  In other words some items may or may not appear depending on the
type of facility selected at the Location tab. Surety information on the Location Detail tab is surety
at the facility level, not at the company level.

<P>Select the Company Detail tab to view parent company information for the owner/operator of a selected
facility. To select a different operator, enter query mode by selecting the enter query icon and inputing
a new owner/operator name or operator number then execute the query.  Another way to find a company is to
double-click the operator name field and select a new operator from the lookup window.</P>

<P <span style='color:#00716E'>Security prevents the Social Security number from being displayed for the public user.  Security
for the data entry personnel depends on a combination of the Site Type and the Parent Company Type.

from the legal location information provided.  The calculations are based on the center of the section if no quarters are
entered.  The Surety information that is displayed on this form is for Commercial Soil Farms only.</P>

<P>The Location tab also provides the ability to query from this form.  One example would be; If you were trying to display
all the Commercial Applications then you would choose Enter Query(F7), put a check mark in the Commerical Box and then
choose Execute Query(F8).  This will retrieve all of the Commercial Soil Farming operations.</P>

<P>The Company Detail tab has information about the company that is contracted out to do the land applications.  Companies
can be added but not deleted once they have performed an application.  The Company tab does not link with the Location tab,
therefore it will not automatically pull up the Company that is listed on the particular Land Application that you are on.
To select a company simply double-click on the company name and a list of all soil farm contracting companies will appear
to select from.</P>

<P><span style='color:#00716E'>When entering a New Land Application it is best to query all records that are in the area
of the New Application then delimit with Township, Range and Section.  When the area has been narrowed down and the insert
button is pressed, the new record will copy the location information from the previous record.  This information can be changed
if it is different.  When the individual Quarters are selected, a pop-up window will appear which will aid in entering quarters.
When entering quarters, the quarter you desire to be displayed the farthest on the left should be entered first.  If more than one
quarter is entered the second quarter will shift the first quarter over one space to the left.  The approve date will default to
todays date, but can also be changed.</P>

<P>The Location Detail Tab has some other fields that may need to be updated when entering a Land App.  The Expiration
Date is automatically set to 90 days after the Approve Date.</span></P>
